        <p><strong>This recipe is bursting with flavor! It is fresh and spicy, 
            and did I mention easy? This is the closest thing to 
            restaurant style salsa you will find. The jalapenos and 
            hot pepper sauce (e.g., Tabasco) add spice to the mix and the cilantro, 
            lime juice, and green onions create freshness.</strong></p>
