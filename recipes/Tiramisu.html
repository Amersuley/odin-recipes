        <h1>Tiramisu Toffee Dessert</h1>

        <img src="../recipes/images/tiramisu.jpeg" alt="" width='300'>

        <p><h5>
            This is a nice version of the popular Italian 
            pick-me-up dessert. The toffee candy in this recipe adds a 
            delightful crunchiness to the smooth creamy
            whipped cream quality of an already perfect dessert.

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Arrange cake slices on bottom of a rectangular 11x7 
                inch baking dish, cutting cake slices if 
                necessary to fit the bottom of the dish. 
                Drizzle coffee over cake.
            </li>

            <li>
                Beat cream cheese, sugar, and chocolate syrup, in a large bowl with an electric mixer 
                on medium speed until smooth. 
                Add heavy cream; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. 
                Spread over cake. Sprinkle with chocolate-covered toffee candy.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, 
                but no longer than 24 hours, 
                to set dessert and blend flavors.
